## 1.1 Aims and Objectives

The primary aim of the research project is to use machine learning models to predict the pIC50 values of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This predictive analysis will provide valuable insights into the potency of these inhibitors. By leveraging the prediction results, the project aspires to contribute to the comprehensive evaluation of drug candidates, enabling an informed assessment of the possibility of a compound to be considered as a viable therapeutic candidate.

As a result, the research has a number of key objectives that it aims to accomplish, including the following:

- To explore the chemical landscape of AChE inhibitors
- To implement and evaluate various machine learning models for drug likeness prediction
- To investigate the relative contributions of the molecular descriptors in predicting drug likeness for AChE inhibitors.
